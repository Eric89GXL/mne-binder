`mne-python <http://mne-tools.github.io/>`_
=======================================================

This package is designed for sensor- and source-space analysis of [M/E]EG
data, including frequency-domain and time-frequency analyses, MVPA/decoding
and non-parametric statistics. This package is presently evolving quickly and
thanks to the adopted open development environment user contributions can
be easily incorporated.

This repository link `MNE-python <http://mne-tools.github.io/>`_ to
`binder <http://mybinder.org/>`_ so as to allow testing the `examples` and
`tutorials` notebooks directly in the browser. Note that examples requiring
`mayavi` won't be able to render the figures.
